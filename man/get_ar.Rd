get_ar(dimension)
}
\value{
A list
}
\description{
This function returns a list with objects such as
* rinit  to sample from the initial distribution
* rtransition to sample from the transition
* dtransition to evaluate the transition density
* dmeasurement to evaluate the measurement density
* generate_randomness to evaluate the measurement density
* perturb_randomness to evaluate the measurement density
* dimension, which represents the dimension of the latent process
